Hello Welcome all to the Pokemon Api Single Page Project

In this project, I used the Pokemon Api ('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/') 
Using async I have fetched all the data stored on Api
Manupilated the data using .json() method for use in this project.

Manly, there are three .addEventListener
1. To Search the data
2. Sort the data
3. View selected data in Module/modal box

Also I have used .forEach(), .sort(), .toLowerCase(), .filter() methods
